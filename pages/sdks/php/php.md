# PHP-SDK integration

Integrating plenigo to handle your digital content sales simplifies the process of checkout and sales management. This page is meant to be a guide for 
developers that want to use the SDK instead of accessing the API, with it you will reduce development, maintenance and test time since all the utilities 
developed are designed and implemented mainly for that purpose.

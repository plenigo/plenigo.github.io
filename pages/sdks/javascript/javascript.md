# JavaScript SDK client side integration

The plenigo JavaScript-SDK offers the possibility to implement the plenigo functionality without a need for a server side request. 

## PayWall functionality

If you plan to use the PayWall functionality of plenigo you have to choose between three different use cases:

### Hide content afterwards

{% include_relative includes/hide_content_afterwards.md %}
   
### Hide content by default

{% include_relative includes/hide_content_by_default.md %}
   
### Load content afterwards
   
{% include_relative includes/load_content_afterwards.md %}
   
## Snippets functionality

{% include_relative includes/snippet_functionality.md %}
   
## General functionality

{% include_relative includes/general_functionality.md %}

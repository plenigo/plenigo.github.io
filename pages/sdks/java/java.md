# Java-SDK integration

Integrating plenigo in your mobile applications enables you to query user information and enable the user to filter his digital content. This page is meant to be a guide for developers that want to use the SDK instead of accessing the API, with it you will reduce development, maintenance and test time since all the utilities developed are designed and implemented mainly for that purpose.

> plenigo relies heavily on correct date times so make sure your servers time is up to date. Running NTP is strongly recommended.
